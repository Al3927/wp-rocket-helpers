Cron script to clear the cache and run a cache preload.

üöß **ADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION, HANDLE WITH CARE!**
üìù **Manual code edit required before use!**

Edit `WPROCKETHELPERS_WP_LOAD_FILE` to reflect the absolute path to wp-load.php from wherever on your server you run this script.

This script does the following:

- Checks WP Rocket is active on the website. If so:
   - Clears the cache.
   - Checks if sitemap preload is configured.
   - If so, runs a sitemap preload; otherwise calls the preload bot.
- Checks if the website is a multisite network.
- If so, iterates over each site in the network, and performs the steps above.
