Set `WPROCKETHELPERS_HTACCESS_USERNAME` as your .htaccess username and `WPROCKETHELPERS_HTACCESS_PASSWORD` as your .htaccess password. 
Hint: Search for `EDIT_ME` in the source code. 

For preload to work, `wp-cron.php` should be whitelisted from .htaccess authorization as well. Please refer doc for more info.
