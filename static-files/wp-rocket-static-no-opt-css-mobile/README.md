# WP Rocket | No Optimized CSS Delivery on Mobile

Disables optimized CSS delivery for mobile devices.

A known issue of the Critical Path CSS generator since WP Rocket 2.11.0 is that there is no mobile specific CSS (yet). As a workaround, this plugin disables _Optimize CSS delivery_ programmatically just for mobile devices.

To be used with:
* any setup where _Mobile Cache_ and _Separate cache files for mobile devices_ are enabled

Last tested with:
* WP Rocket 2.11.5
* WordPress 4.9.x
