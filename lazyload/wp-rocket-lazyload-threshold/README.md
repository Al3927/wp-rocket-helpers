# WP Rocket | LazyLoad Threshold

Define a custom threshold value for lazy-loaded images.

üìù&#160;&#160;**Manual code edit required before use!**

Edit `WPROCKETHELPERS_LL_CUSTOM_THRESHOLD` to define your own threshold.

_The threshold parameter defines the space in px below the browser viewport where the LazyLoad script would start to load images._

_The default threshold of 300 means that when an (empty) image container gets scrolled up to a position of 300 px below the viewport, the script starts loading that image._

_For pages with larger images it can make sense to define a larger threshold, according to the average image height._
